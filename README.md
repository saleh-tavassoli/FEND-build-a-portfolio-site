# Project: Build A Portfolio Site



## Why this project?
The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to show off your skills.

In this project you’ll build a great looking portfolio where you can show off images, descriptions and links to all of your projects.

## What will I learn?
You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. You’ll then learn how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.

## Why is this important to my career?
* Without a portfolio, recruiters won’t even look at your resume much less interview you.
* At their very foundation, web applications are just content delivery mechanisms; HTML defines how that language is structured.
* Reading poorly designed content is never an enjoyable experience; CSS empowers you to create beautiful content regardless of your user’s device.
